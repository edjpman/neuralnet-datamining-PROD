# neuralnet-datamining-PROD

**Overview**

The following repository is for the INFO 523 (Data Mining) final project instructed by Dr. Cristian Rom√°n-Palacios at the University of Arizona College of Information Science. The codebase specifically covers an applied example of Neural Networks to mine stock data for an indication of future stock movement. The application of this algorithm is an extension of the foundations of supervised methods covered in class, with emphasis on applying multilayered Neural Networks to mine increasingly complex information spaces.

**Goals**

The goal of this framework is to extract stock data that can quantitatively represent features that investment professionals assess in the markets along with technical analysis patterns as predictors of future movement. A perfectly formed model for this data mining task would be able to accurately determine patterns in the data that are precursors to an expected movement size in a financial instrument. This would then be represented as a binary flag to indicate the potential movement on a sequential time scale.

**Future**

While this is a rudimentary foundation for how Neural Networks may be implemented for this data mining task, additional development in the base dataset and model itself may prove effective in extracting highly sought after information that financial professionals can utilize.
